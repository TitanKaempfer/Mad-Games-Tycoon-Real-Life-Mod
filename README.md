# Mad-Games-Tycoon-Real-Life-Mod
This is a collection of mod files created by me, to replace all fake names and screenshots with their real life counter parts. Additionally the mod adds new competitors, developer legends, NPC games, IPs and more.

# What does the mod add/change?
- Anti Cheat Systems
- Copy Protection Systems
- Developer Legends
- Licenses
- NPC Addons
- NPC Engines
- NPC Games
- NPC IPs
- NPC Spinoffs
- Platforms
- Publisher
- Quotes (currently only for German)
- Random Company Names
- Random Game Names (replaced with a huge list of fake names to avoid accidentially naming your game after NPC Games)
- Random Platform Names
- Screenshots (in the future)

# How to install the mod?
Download the text and image files and replace the default game files with them. Make sure you backup your game files before doing so. You will find the files to replace in the following directory: 
"[PATH TO YOUR STEAM GAMES]\steamapps\common\Mad Games Tycoon 2\Mad Games Tycoon 2_Data\Extern".

Most changes will also only take place in a new save game, so make sure to start a new game.
